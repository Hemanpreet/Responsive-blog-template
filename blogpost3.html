        The early days of Instagram were blissful; we shared our cooking escapades, beach vacations, matching family outfits on Christmas, dogs, and really anything else that struck our fancy.
But now, social media is leveraged, curated, and targeted. It‚Äôs teeming with information, and rife with conflict. It‚Äôs entertaining and explosive, pedantic and volatile, and recently, I‚Äôve been questioning my relationship with it.
You see, along the way, Instagram made specific product changes that promote not only engagement, but also argument, and not just reactions, but also excessive ones. By consuming social media so consistently, I‚Äôm being trained into specific behaviors that affect how I navigate both my Internet and my IRL (in real life) relationships.
Reacting (and I‚Äôm not just talking about likes)
On essentially any social media or messaging platform, you can react to content with a variety of ‚Äúreactions‚Äù, whether it‚Äôs a heart, a thumbs up, a crying face, an angry face, or the ambiguous wow face üòÆ.
Previously, these reactions were primarily used to react to posts, say a Facebook status update or an Instagram feed post.

Recently, however, messaging platforms like Messenger or Signal have launched updates that allow reacting to messages in a conversation using the same emojis. Messenger even allows selecting any emoji you‚Äôd like, creating a buffet of 3,300 options to choose from.
At first glance, perhaps this is a small and logical update, but it‚Äôs ultimately a major shift in the way we communicate. Instead of responding with words, we often utilize message reactions to signify acknowledgement without the investment of written words. We offer validation to the message‚Äôs author, but ultimately the message didn‚Äôt hold enough content to elicit a response. What does this teach us?
Reactions allow us to respond with so little effort that it can be done without internalizing the content of the original message. I can read something my sister texted me, react with an emoji, and then wonder to myself three seconds later what she even said. It allows us to engage without processing, and the muscle of intentional conversation atrophies.
Also, having been the author of a message in a group chat that elicits no response, written or emoji, I know that the absence of a reaction now invokes anxiousness. When reacting to messages becomes the default, we worry when our message gets no response at all, since adding an emoji requires such little work. Online silence becomes unbearable, weighty, when in real life we know that not everything in a conversation has to be responded to directly.
We‚Äôve created a dichotomy in which we crave acknowledgement and reaction, and yet the responses often hold so little additive value.
Being quick to the punch
We already know that online conversation leaves little room for nuance, especially when you‚Äôre shouting at an complete stranger at 3am, but social media also tends to have a certain tone or cadence to it.
Social media plays favorites, in that the first witty comment to a post gets the most likes and retweets. The Internet prefers succinct, pithy, witty remarks, and it rewards those who are quick on their feet with digital applause. Snippiness becomes our preferred language.
This teaches us to evaluate others‚Äô thoughts with some very ill-rounded criteria:
Did that sentence entertain me in some way, perhaps make me laugh?
Was it as sharp as a tack?
Did it get the point across without needing more than a few words?
And I believe that the more we spend our time digitally, the less we remember to ask questions such as:
Did that sentence make me think? Is there something more I can learn?
Does it have weight to it?
Can the point be extended, developed if you pull at it? Will it fall apart if I poke it here and there?
Now you might be thinking this is all a little nit-picky. After all, who doesn‚Äôt enjoy wit, and an emoji that perfectly conveys a sentiment? I certainly do.
Though maybe next time, I won‚Äôt feel the need to respond to every message with an emoji, or I‚Äôll decide to take an extra five seconds to type out a response. Perhaps I‚Äôll pause before quipping back at someone, and I‚Äôll remind myself to be more thoughtful.
These are the two tensions of our modern, increasingly digital world: efficiency and depth.
