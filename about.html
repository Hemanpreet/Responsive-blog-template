        <h1>What is iBlog and is iBlog reliable?</h1>
        <p>
          iBlog is a fantastic source of articles from a huge variety of
          writers, poets, and comic artists from around the World. It’s the
          Youtube of writing. You can come here to read — as over 200 million
          people do a month — or to share your articles and stories with a huge
          audience. iBlog also runs several professional in-house publications,
          whereby they are fully staffed with fact-checkers and full-time
          editors. They’ve even stepped up during this world pandemic and
          created a publication for constant updates on the virus. It’s become
          quite popular and is a great source for people searching for medical
          news on iBlog.com. Some people do feel that these in-house
          publications take on a certain bias. But as the platform is wide-open,
          you don’t have to read (or post) to their publications if you don’t
          want to. Y ou are also able to block publications from your newsfeed
          if you don’t like seeing any topics/writers.
