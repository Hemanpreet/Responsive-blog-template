        Have you ever hold a chameleon in your hand?
        They are incredibly amazing creatures with awesome traits.
        Many people are afraid of chameleons. For the most part, it is merely because chameleons are reptiles, a group of animals for which humans have historically had a distaste.
        Moreover, chameleons are very different from most mammals. The fact that they are able to dramatically change their skin color, their long tongues can strike with pinpoint accuracy, and their vision is almost 360-degree — are all abilities that appear almost alien to us.
        Fear is a normal instinctive reaction when facing the unknown.
        The chameleon's weird traits tend to unsettle me as a kid. Recently I had an encounter with one of these creatures. Lockdown forced me however not to run away this time. So, I started looking at this creature's curious and almost fantastical abilities.
        By the end of the lockdown, I grasped thrilling lessons from the chameleon, which could help you through challenging situations too.
        Keep A Simple Intention In Mind All The Time
        A chameleon never turns its head away from the direction that it takes. Instead, it turns its bulging and swiveling eyes. The chameleon is able to scan the surroundings of its environment while keeping its direction locked.
        In turbulent circonstances, I am sure you too can keep a precise objective, simple enough to not overwhelm you. We are fit to retain that objective in mind while scanning, collecting information about anything that could affect us as an individual or could impact any collective endeavor as a family or as a team.
        Accept The Impermanence of Life
        When a chameleon reaches a place, it takes the color of that place. For me, this is a delighting showcase of tolerance and acceptance of the unknown.
        Throughout the pandemic and lockdown, we had the unique opportunity to cultivate refraining from judging others, while prioritizing comprehending, and acknowledging any reasons or objections raised by people we interact with.
        Celebrate Your Achievments
        When a chameleon raises two legs, it balances them in the air, in order to make sure that the remaining two legs are still stably grounded. It looks like a dance of hesitation.
        In the midst of disruption and social distancing, we are especially required to be very careful when moving on. We take action only after securing the outcome of our previous achievements by celebrating them.
        Take Care Of Yourself And Others
        When a chameleon moves, it rolls its tail around a stable object to rescue itself if it accidentally falls.
        During the pandemic, we worked at becoming more careful and at taking care of people who are most precious to us. These few folks are those who kept polishing our diamonds regardless of what was going on outside.
        The chameleon inspires us to secure our basic self, by sustaining activities that provide for our elemental needs. We don’t want to lose ourselves along the way.
        The world is still facing the development of the Covid-19 pandemic. The chameleon teaches us how to value our conversations a bit more despite being less confident about the future.
        It shows us how to feel more connected with our environment, as a team, not as competitors, because we have a new beginning every single day. You deserve to be kind to yourself with compassion.
        With sprint in the air, today, more than ever, we can choose our attitude.
